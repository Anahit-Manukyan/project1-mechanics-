//some ideas 

/*
we need to consider the fact that M3 is smaller than M2,
however it pulls down M2
also, there exist gravitation force, which influences vertically 

problem 2.2 is much like to this problem and we can use it as a hint
the only difference is that we have force from the right side 


in order to have different inputs and then outputs, as en experiment
we can run the program by randomizing the inputs


By using the quiz3 solution, we get that
M3 cannot be out of the hole => the walls of M1 act on it horizonatally
